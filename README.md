# A simple widget for calculating savings

Just insert your data into the fields and let the widget figure it out

# Assumptions

- The widget has not error handling of any kind
- The currency fields are only number, no type of currency can be discerned by the input value (further development needed)
- The sliders are not currently working (further development needed)

# For Developers

 - This widget was developed with the help of [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

When you have all the above just clone the repo in local machine:

And now you are ready to code. :D
